# fuzzy-logic-delta_ail


This algorithm has been obtained by performing multiple tests with 
different sizes of overlap between the labels, and changing the number of labels to achieve the best result.

The final accuracy obtained in the tests was: 6.03e-07

The mean square error has been used as a function for measuring precision.
